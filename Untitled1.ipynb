       "  'readme_contents': '# Movies Application\\n\\nFor this project, we will be building a single page movie application (SPA). It\\nwill allow users to add, edit, and delete movies, as well as rate them. We will\\nbe using [`json-server`](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to mock a\\ndatabase and our backend, so that we can just worry about the front end and AJAX\\nrequests.\\n\\nThe webpack dev server is configured to watch for changes both in the javascript\\nsource, as well as the `public` directory. Whenever changes are detected, the\\npage will be reloaded. It will also proxy any requests that start with `/api` to\\nlocalhost:3000, which is where json-server is configured run.\\n\\n`json-server` is configured to have a delay of 1.2 seconds, so you can see what\\nyour application might actually look like, instead of serving instantaneous\\nreponses. You can modify this behavior by changing (or removing) the number\\nafter the `-d` flag inside of the npm `dev` script.\\n\\n## Setup\\n\\n1. Fork this repository to your own github account or your github organization.\\n\\n1. Clone your fork locally into your computer.\\n\\n1. Run `npm install`\\n\\n1. Run `npm run build`\\n\\n1. Run `npm run dev` and visit\\n   [http://localhost:1313/](http://localhost:1313/) in your browser. Open up\\n   the console and inspect the output.\\n\\n## Development\\n\\nIn general, you should have the development web server (`npm run dev`) running\\nwhile you are working on the project. You should view your project through\\nhttp://localhost:1313, **not** from IntelliJ\\'s web server, or by dragging the\\nfile(s) into chrome. As you make changes to your source files, all you need to\\ndo is save the file, and the website will be live reloaded.\\n\\nTake a look at the `src/index.js` file to get started. You will notice it has\\nexamples of importing and requiring separate javascript files. Regardless of\\nwhich you choose to use, you should pick one and use it throughout your code\\nbase, don\\'t mix and match the two.\\n\\nThe file `src/api.js` also contains an example api request. You can\\nreference this to get started building out the parts of your application that\\ninteract with the api.\\n\\nThe `db.json` file contains your \"database\". You can edit this file directly to\\nmake changes to your data, and this file will be updated if you make api\\nrequests that modify the data.\\n\\nThe server will serve files from the `public` directory, meaning any files\\noutside of `public` will not be visible. This means if you have any frontend\\nassets (e.g. bootstrap, or images) they will need to be in the `public`\\ndirectory.\\n\\n## Specification\\n\\nYour application should:\\n\\nOn page load:\\n\\n- Display a \"loading...\" message\\n- Make an ajax request to get a listing of all the movies\\n- When the initial ajax request comes back, remove the \"loading...\" message\\n  and replace it with HTML generated from the json response your code\\n  receives\\n\\nAllow users to add new movies\\n\\n- Create a form for adding a new movie that has fields for the movie\\'s title\\n  and rating\\n- When the form is submitted, the page should **not** reload / refresh,\\n  instead, your javascript should make a POST request to `/api/movies` with the\\n  information the user put into the form\\n\\nAllow users to edit existing movies\\n\\n- Give users the option to edit an existing movie\\n- A form should be pre-populated with the selected movie\\'s details\\n- Like creating a movie, this should not involve any page reloads, instead\\n  your javascript code should make an ajax request when the form is\\n  submitted.\\n\\nDelete movies\\n\\n- Each movie should have a \"delete\" button\\n- When this button is clicked, your javascript should send a `DELETE` request\\n\\n### Bonuses\\n\\n- Add a `disabled` attribute to buttons while their corresponding ajax request\\n  is still pending.\\n- Show a loading animation instead of just text that says \"loading...\"\\n- Use modals for the creating and editing movie forms\\n- Add a `genre` property to every movie\\n- Allow users to sort the movies by rating, title, or genre (if you have it)\\n- Allow users to search through the movies by rating, title, or genre (if you\\n  have it)\\n\\n## Helpful Hints\\n\\n- The id property of every movie should not be edited by hand. The purpose of\\n  this property is to uniquely identify that particular movie. That is, if we\\n  want to delete or modify an existing movie, we can specify what movie we want\\n  to change by referencing it\\'s id. When a new movie is created (i.e.  when you\\n  send a `POST` request to `/api/movies` with a title and a rating), the server\\n  will respond with the movie object that was created, including a generated id.\\n- Take a look at the other branches in this repository, as they have\\n  configuration/setup for common scenarios, such as including bootstrap in your\\n  application.\\n'},\n",

Install Python 2.7 for Windows (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2716/). The Windows x86-64 MSI installer is fine. This is required for the build system execution and many dependencies.\\n\\nYou should change the installation to install the \"Add python.exe to Path\" feature.\\n\\nYou will also need to set the `PYTHON2` environment variable, e.g., to \\'C:\\\\Python27\\\\python.exe\\' by doing:\\n```\\nsetx PYTHON2 \"C:\\\\Python27\\\\python.exe\" /m\\n```\\n\\n2. Install Python 3.7 for Windows (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-374/). The Windows x86-64 MSI installer is fine. This is required in order to build the JavaScript engine, SpiderMonkey.\\n\\nYou will also need to set the `PYTHON3` environment variable, e.g., to \\'C:\\\\Python37\\\\python.exe\\' by doing:\\n```\\nsetx PYTHON3 \"C:\\\\Python37\\\\python.exe\" /m\\n```\\nThe `/m` will set it system-wide for all future command windows.\\n\\n3. Install virtualenv.\\n\\n In a normal Windows Shell (cmd.exe or \"Command Prompt\" from the start menu), do:\\n ```\\npip install virtualenv\\n```\\n If this does not work, you may need to reboot for the changed PATH settings (by the python installer) to take effect.\\n\\n4. Install the most recent [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/pkg/windows/) MSVC packages. You need to download the two `.msi` files for your platform from the [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/pkg/windows/) website and install them. The currently recommended version is 1.16.0. i.e.:\\n\\n- [gstreamer-1.0-msvc-x86_64-1.16.0.msi](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/pkg/windows/1.16.0/gstreamer-1.0-msvc-x86_64-1.16.0.msi)\\n- [gstreamer-1.0-devel-msvc-x86_64-1.16.0.msi](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/pkg/windows/1.16.0/gstreamer-1.0-devel-msvc-x86_64-1.16.0.msi)\\n\\nNote that the MinGW binaries will not work, so make sure that you install the MSVC the ones.\\n\\nNote that you should ensure that _all_ components are installed from gstreamer, as we require many of the optional libraries that are not installed by default.\\n\\n5. Install Git for Windows (https://git-scm.com/download/win). DO allow it to add git.exe to the PATH (default\\nsettings for the installer are fine).\\n\\n6. Install Visual Studio Community 2017 (https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/). You MUST add \"Visual C++\" to the\\nlist of installed components as well as the \"Windows Universal C runtime.\" They are not on by default. Visual Studio 2017 MUST installed to the default location or mach.bat will not find it.\\n\\nNote that version is hard to download online and is easier to install via [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install#installing-chocolatey) with:\\n```\\nchoco install -y visualstudio2017community --package-parameters=\"\\'--add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.Git\\'\"\\nUpdate-SessionEnvironment #refreshing env due to Git install\\n\\n#--- UWP Workload and installing Windows Template Studio ---\\nchoco install -y visualstudio2017-workload-nativedesktop\\n```\\n\\n##### [Optional] Install LLVM for faster link times\\n\\nYou may experience much faster builds on Windows by following these steps. (Related Rust issue: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/37543)\\n\\n1. Download the latest version of LLVM (https://releases.llvm.org/).\\n2. Run the installer and choose to add LLVM to the system PATH.\\n3. Add the following to your Cargo config (Found at `%USERPROFILE%\\\\.cargo\\\\config`). You may need to change the triple to match your environment.\\n\\n```\\n[target.x86_64-pc-windows-msvc]\\nlinker = \"lld-link.exe\"\\n```\\n\\n##### Troubleshooting a Windows environment\\n\\n> If you encountered errors with the environment above, do the following for a workaround:\\n> 1.  Download and install [Build Tools for Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=BuildTools&rel=15)\\n> 2.  Install `python2.7 x86-x64` and `virtualenv`\\n> 3.  Run `mach.bat build -d`.\\n\\n>If you have troubles with `x64 type` prompt as `mach.bat` set by default:\\n> 1. You may need to choose and launch the type manually, such as `x86_x64 Cross Tools Command Prompt for VS 2017` in the Windows menu.)\\n> 2. `cd to/the/path/servo`\\n> 3. `python mach build -d`\\n\\n> If you got the error `Cannot run mach in a path on a case-sensitive file system on Windows`:\\n> 1.

See wiki for\\n[details](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Building-for-Android).\\n\\n## The Rust compiler\\n\\nServo\\'s build system uses rustup.rs to automatically download a Rust compiler.\\nThis is a specific version of Rust Nightly determined by the\\n[`rust-toolchain`](https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/master/rust-toolchain) file.\\n\\n## Building\\n\\nServo is built with [Cargo](https://crates.io/), the Rust package manager. We also use Mozilla\\'s\\nMach tools to orchestrate the build and other tasks.\\n\\n### Normal build\\n\\nTo build Servo in development mode.  This is useful for development, but\\nthe resulting binary is very slow.\\n\\n``` sh\\ngit clone https://github.com/servo/servo\\ncd servo\\n./mach build --dev\\n./mach run tests/html/about-mozilla.html\\n```\\n\\nOr on Windows MSVC, in a normal Command Prompt (cmd.exe):\\n``` cmd\\ngit clone https://github.com/servo/servo\\ncd servo\\nmach.bat build --dev\\n```\\n\\nFor benchmarking, performance testing, or\\nreal-world use, add the `--release` flag to create an optimized build:\\n\\n``` sh\\n./mach build --release\\n./mach run --release tests/html/about-mozilla.html\\n```\\n\\n**Note:** `mach build ` will build both `servo` and `libsimpleservo`. To make compilation a bit faster, it\\'s possible to only compile the servo binary: `./mach build --dev -p servo`.\\n\\n### Checking for build errors, without building\\n\\nIf you’re making changes to one crate that cause build errors in another crate,\\nconsider this instead of a full build:\\n\\n```sh\\n./mach check\\n```\\n\\nIt will run `cargo check`, which runs the analysis phase of the compiler\\n(and so shows build errors if any) but skips the code generation phase.\\nThis can be a lot faster than a full build,\\nthough of course it doesn’t produce a binary you can run.\\n\\n### Building for Android target\\n\\nFor ARM (`armv7-linux-androideabi`, most phones):\\n\\n``` sh\\n./mach build --release --android\\n./mach package --release --android\\n```\\n\\nFor x86 (typically for the emulator):\\n\\n```sh\\n./mach build --release --target i686-linux-android\\n./mach package --release --target i686-linux-android\\n```\\n\\n## Running\\n\\nRun Servo with the command:\\n\\n```sh\\n./servo [url] [arguments] # if you run with nightly build\\n./mach run [url] [arguments] # if you run with mach\\n\\n# For example\\n./mach run https://www.google.com\\n```\\n\\n### Commandline Arguments\\n\\n- `-p INTERVAL` turns on the profiler and dumps info to the console every\\n  `INTERVAL` seconds\\n- `-s SIZE` sets the tile size for painting; defaults to 512\\n- `-z` disables all graphical output; useful for running JS / layout tests\\n- `-Z help` displays useful output to debug servo\\n\\n### Keyboard Shortcuts\\n\\n- `Ctrl`+`L` opens URL prompt (`Cmd`+`L` on Mac)\\n- `Ctrl`+`R` reloads current page (`Cmd`+`R` on Mac)\\n- `Ctrl`+`-` zooms out (`Cmd`+`-` on Mac)\\n- `Ctrl`+`=` zooms in (`Cmd`+`=` on Mac)\\n- `Alt`+`left arrow` goes backwards in the history (`Cmd`+`left arrow` on Mac)\\n- `Alt`+`right arrow` goes forwards in the history (`Cmd`+`right arrow` on Mac)\\n- `Esc` or `Ctrl`+`Q` exits Servo (`Cmd`+`Q` on Mac)\\n\\n## Developing\\n\\nThere are lots of mach commands you can use. You can list them with `./mach\\n--help`.\\n\\n\\nThe generated documentation can be found on https://doc.servo.org/servo/index.html\\n'}]"
